# espanso-mutants

This is a data-oriented repo, so we can store the output of cargo-mutants for the
`espanso/espanso` repo.

In a M2 Mac mini, took 2h 36m to test 3798 mutants, and most of them failed.

This run is based on the commit `93e1faf26e0d6f07f7f6febb5cdcf661da73d83d`

You can find patches and logs for every test in the `diff/` and `log/` folders
